    "Q1.What is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading in Python involves running multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within the same program. Each thread operates independently, allowing different tasks to be performed simultaneously. \n",
    "Python's threading module is commonly used to handle threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used for various reasons, including:\n",
    "1.Concurrency: \n",
    "    Multithreading allows you to execute multiple tasks concurrently. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you want to perform multiple operations simultaneously without waiting for one to finish before starting the next one.\n",
    "2.Responsiveness: \n",
    "    Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program, especially in situations where certain tasks, such as I/O operations (e.g., reading from or writing to a file or a network), may cause the program to be idle. While one thread is waiting for I/O to complete, another thread can continue executing, making better use of the available resources.\n",
    "3.Parallelism for I/O-Bound Tasks: \n",
    "    In cases where the bottleneck is I/O operations rather than CPU processing power, multithreading can be beneficial. Threads can perform I/O operations concurrently, improving overall efficiency."

    "Q5. State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "1.Concurrency:\n",
    "Advantage: \n",
    "    Multithreading allows multiple tasks to execute concurrently, making better use of resources and potentially improving the overall performance of a program.\n",
    "2.Responsiveness:\n",
    "Advantage: \n",
    "    Multithreading can enhance the responsiveness of a program, particularly in applications where certain tasks, such as I/O operations, can be performed independently in separate threads.\n",
    "3.Parallelism for I/O-Bound Tasks:\n",
    "Advantage: \n",
    "    For I/O-bound tasks, where the program is often waiting for input or output operations to complete, multithreading can be advantageous as it allows other threads to execute during the wait time.\n",
    "4.Modularity:\n",
    "Advantage: \n",
    "    Multithreading can be used to structure a program in a modular way, with different threads handling different aspects of a task. This can lead to cleaner and more maintainable code.\n",
    "5.Resource Sharing:\n",
    "Advantage: \n",
    "    Threads within the same process can share resources, such as memory space. This can be beneficial for communication and data sharing between threads.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "1.Complexity:\n",
    "Disadvantage: \n",
    "    Multithreading introduces complexity to a program. Coordinating the execution of multiple threads requires careful synchronization to avoid issues such as data races and deadlocks.\n",
    "2.Difficulty in Debugging:\n",
    "Disadvantage: \n",
    "    Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to the non-deterministic nature of thread execution. Issues like race conditions may not be easily reproducible.\n",
    "3.Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython:\n",
    "Disadvantage: \n",
    "    In CPython, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the execution of multiple threads in a single process, particularly in CPU-bound tasks. This can hinder true parallelism and impact performance.\n",
    "4.Overhead:\n",
    "Disadvantage: \n",
    "    Creating and managing threads comes with some overhead. This includes the overhead of creating and switching between threads, which may outweigh the benefits in certain scenarios.\n",
    "5.Potential for Resource Contentions:\n",
    "Disadvantage: \n",
    "    Threads within the same process share resources, and if not managed properly, this can lead to contentions and conflicts. For example, simultaneous access to shared data may result in race conditions."

    "Q6. Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks:\n",
    " A deadlock is a situation in a multitasking or multiprogramming environment where two or more processes cannot proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. In other words, a set of processes is deadlocked when each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key conditions for a deadlock to occur:\n",
    "Mutual Exclusion: \n",
    "    At least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode. This means that only one process can use the resource at a time.\n",
    "Hold and Wait: \n",
    "    A process must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently held by other processes.\n",
    "No Preemption: \n",
    "    Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from a process; a process must release the resources voluntarily.\n",
    "Circular Wait: \n",
    "    A cycle must exist in the resource allocation graph. This means that there must be a chain of two or more processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next one in the chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve deadlocks, various strategies can be employed, such as resource allocation policies, deadlock detection, and recovery mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "  A race condition occurs in a concurrent system when the behavior of a program depends on the relative timing of events, such as the order in which threads are scheduled for execution. These issues arise when multiple threads or processes access shared data concurrently, and at least one of them modifies the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key conditions for a race condition to occur:\n",
    "Shared Data: \n",
    "    Two or more threads must access shared data or resources.\n",
    "At Least One Write Operation: \n",
    "    At least one of the threads must perform a write operation on the shared data.\n",
    "Non-Atomic Operations: \n",
    "    The operations performed on the shared data are not atomic, meaning they are not indivisible and can be interrupted.\n",
    "No Proper Synchronization: \n",
    "    There is no proper synchronization mechanism in place to coordinate access to the shared data among multiple threads."
